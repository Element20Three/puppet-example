# Puppet Enterprise Console

- Works separate than the puppet enterprise core
- A variable defined in the console is a top scope variable (same as a variable defined in site.pp outside a node definition)

## Event Inspector

Puppet Enterprise (PE) event inspector is a reporting tool that provides data for investigating the current state of your infrastructure.

An event is puppet's attempt to modify a resource.
